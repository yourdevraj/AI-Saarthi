Empowering Rural Youth with Skill and Career Clarity
________________________________________
# Overview
AI Saarthi is a mobile friendly and AI supported skill mapping and career clarity platform designed for rural youth.
It identifies strengths, maps relevant skills, recommends suitable pathways and makes district level opportunities visible in a simple and accessible way.
The platform provides personalised guidance through a short assessment and generates a clear roadmap that helps youth make informed decisions.

# Problem
Rural youth complete school with limited clarity about skills, careers and opportunities.
They often rely on random advice rather than structured guidance.
More than sixty percent rural youth face skill mismatch and under employment.
Despite having smartphones, they do not have a guidance system that is personalised, localised and easy to understand.
This gap affects students, dropouts, job seekers and especially rural girls.
